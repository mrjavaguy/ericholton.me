    name: ' Asynchronous Task Execution'
    publisher: 'US Patent #8713571'
    releaseDate: '2014-05-29'
    summary: 'Techniques for asynchronous task execution are described. In an implementation, tasks may be initiated and executed asynchronously, thereby allowing a plurality of calls to be made in parallel. Each task may be associated with a respective timeout that triggers an end to execution of the task. If a timeout for a low priority task expires without completing both the low priority task and a relatively higher priority task, then the low priority task may use the relatively higher priority task to extend execution time of the low priority task in order to allow additional time to perform the low priority task.'

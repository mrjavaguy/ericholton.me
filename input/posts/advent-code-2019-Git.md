# Advent of Code 2019 - Git

On the 16th for star 2, I had dig back into my memory on how to do dynamic program. This was required to have the problem end in a reasonable amount of time. I still think that I am missing an optimization somewhere as it did not finish in under 2 seconds like some other ones did.

So the 18th was a good reminder of why to use Git and commit often. I was having issue getting the second star due to some bug in the code. I fixed somethings in the code and then I got the right answer. However, since I had made multiple changes over a couple of coding sessions, I have really am not completely sure what fixed the issue.

The second star on the 22nd completely relied on Math, I will admit to doing a fair amount of web searching to help find the formulas needed to solve this problem.

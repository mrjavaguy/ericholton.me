# Advent of Code 2019 - IntComputer

Again this year as have started working on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), due to some time constraints this year,
I am doing the challenges in C#. So far, multiple challenges have built up and use a simulated computer, referred as the IntComputer. I have so far just written an interpreter for the OpCodes. I have thought about using Roslyn to translate the computer into C# code but I am struggling in how to do this completely as the computer can rewrite it's instruction set. I have also been bad in that I have not yet created a git repository for my code yet.

# Blog Setup Using Wyam

In my quest to establish a dynamic yet efficient platform for my blog, I turned to static site generators as a robust solution. After exploring various options, I decided to use Wyam, an open-source static site generator built on C# and .Net Core. The cross-platform capability of Wyam not only suits my development environment but also has the potential to reduce hosting costs significantly.

## Why Wyam?

Wyam is particularly appealing due to its integration with .Net Core, offering a familiar environment for those accustomed to the C# ecosystem. Its cross-platform nature means that it can run on any operating system that supports .Net, which provides flexibility in terms of where and how you can manage your blog.

## Current Setup and Plans for Enhancement

Currently, I am utilizing the basic features of Wyam, which includes generating the site and manually uploading it via SFTP. However, my vision for the blog doesn't stop here. I am actively planning to:

- **Automate Deployment:** Implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines to streamline the process of updates and new posts, making the workflow as efficient as possible.
  
- **Custom Styling and Features:** While Wyam provides a solid foundation, customizing the look and feel of the blog to better reflect my personal style and adding unique features will help in creating a more engaging user experience.

## Future Updates

As I enhance the functionality and aesthetics of my blog using Wyam, I will share updates and insights gained from integrating these new features. Keep an eye on this space for more detailed posts on automating deployment processes and customizing Wyam to fit bespoke needs.

Wyam offers a powerful platform for developers looking to deploy static sites efficiently, and I am excited about the possibilities it holds for my blog's future development.

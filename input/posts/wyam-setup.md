# Blog Setup

![Wyam](/assets/images/Wyam.png)
I decided to use a static site generator for my blog. After looking around for a little while. I decide to use Wyam, which is an open source 
static site generator written in C# on the .Net Core. This makes it cross platform, thus has the potential to lower the cost of hosting this site.
So far, I am only using the basic features of Wyam, including manually uploading via sftp. I do plan in the future to add automation to deploying
this site. I also plan to add custom styling as well as some custom features. I will update this post as I do this.

# Goodbye Visual Studio

I have decided that I will switch full-time from Visual Studio to Visual Studio Code as my primary IDE. VSCode has everything that I need and supports many more languages. I am also like the extension library that VSCode has. I am looking forward to using [remote container development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) as well.

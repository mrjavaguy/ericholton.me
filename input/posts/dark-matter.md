# Dark Matter

One of my resolutions for the new year is to stop being a [Dark Matter Developer](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx).
I have on and off over the years been more and less involved in the developer community. But for the last eight years or so, I have not been involved much at all.
In order to rectify this I am setting myself several **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**ealistic, **T**ime-bound goals for the year.

* 26 blog post for the year.
* attend 12 user group meetings.
* speak at 1 user group meeting.
* contribute to 1 open source project.
* learn a new programming language.

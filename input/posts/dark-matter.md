# Stepping Out of the Shadows: My Commitment to Stop Being a Dark Matter Developer

Inspired by Scott Hanselman's concept of [Dark Matter Developers](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx), I've resolved to step out of the shadows in the coming year. For too long, I've been part of the silent majority of developers who remain disengaged from the broader tech community. While I've had periods of greater involvement, the last eight years have seen me retreat into the background.

It's time for a change. To reconnect with the community and grow both personally and professionally, I've set several **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**ealistic, and **T**ime-bound (SMART) goals for myself this year:

- **Write 26 Blog Posts:** Aiming for one post every two weeks to share knowledge, insights, and experiences.
- **Attend 12 User Group Meetings:** Engaging monthly with local and online groups to network and learn.
- **Speak at 1 User Group Meeting:** Stepping up to share expertise and contribute to the community dialogue.
- **Contribute to 1 Open Source Project:** Giving back to the community by supporting software I use and believe in.
- **Learn a New Programming Language:** Expanding my technical skills and understanding of different paradigms.

This commitment marks a new chapter in my career, where I aim not just to observe but to actively participate and make a difference. Hereâ€™s to a year of growth, connection, and contribution!

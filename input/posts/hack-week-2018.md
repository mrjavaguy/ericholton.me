# IQVia Hack Week 2018
Starting on Monday 2018-02-12 to Friday 2018-02-16, IQVia is doing a hack week in the Seattle office. Last Friday, I presented my idea of a stand-up bot for slack. This was after I abandon the three other ideas that I had put into the pot for hack week. My goal with this project is to learn more about the following technologies
* nodejs
* GraphQL
* PostgreSQL

One nice thing is that we already have a chat bot for slack as the base for this application. I will be given more details about this application during this week.

[Update]
Or not as things went south with the main application I am working on, so I had no time for the Standup Bot :(.

## Notes

### Additional Refactoring Question

> After the initial flocking factoring is done.

* Do any method have the same shape?
* Do any methods take an argumment of the same name?
* Do arguments of the same name always mean the same thing?
* If you were going to break this class into two pieces, where's the dividing line?
* Do the test in the conditional have anything in common?
* How many brfamchjes do the conditionals have?
* Do the methids contain any code *other* the the conditional?
* Does each method depend more on the argument that passed, or on the class as a whole?

### Squint Test

* Put the code of interest on your screen
* Lean back
* Squint your eyes such that you can still see the code, but can nop longer read it.
* Look for:
  - changes in shape
  - changes in color

> To me the code map feature of VSCode does the same thing as the squint test.

### Primitive Obsession

primitives are the built-in data types (string, numbers, booleans). Idealy, you should create a new class to define what the primitive means in terms of the domain.

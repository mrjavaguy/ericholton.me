## Currently Reading

I am currently delving into "[99 Bottles of OOP - 2nd Edition](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles)" by Sandi Metz. This book is a deep dive into object-oriented programming and provides practical techniques to improve code quality.

## Notes on Flocking Rules

### Flocking Rules

As I work through the book, I've been particularly fascinated by the concept of "Flocking Rules," which Sandi Metz uses to refine and simplify code. Hereâ€™s a quick summary of these rules:

- **Select the things that are most alike:** Identify elements within the code that share similarities. This can be structural, functional, or conceptual.

- **Find the smallest difference between them:** Pinpoint the minimal distinctions that separate these similar elements. This might involve differences in behavior, data usage, or outputs.

- **Make the simplest change that will remove that difference:**
  - **Parse the new code:** Ensure the new code can be read and understood.
  - **Parse and execute it:** Check that the code not only makes sense but also runs correctly.
  - **Parse, execute, and use its result:** Integrate the code so that its output is utilized effectively.
  - **Delete unused code:** Remove any code that has become obsolete or redundant after these changes.

These rules offer a systematic approach to gradually refining a codebase, making it more maintainable and less complex over time. The insights from "99 Bottles of OOP" are proving invaluable as I strive to enhance my skills in software design and development.

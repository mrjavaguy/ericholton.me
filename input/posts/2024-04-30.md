# From Wyam to Statiq: Transitioning to a Supported Static Site Generator

After a period of prolonged consideration, I finally took the plunge and updated my static site generator from Wyam to [Statiq](https://www.statiq.dev/). The decision was primarily driven by the discontinuation of support for Wyam, prompting a shift to a more sustainable and actively developed platform.

## Why the Switch Was Necessary

Statiq not only offers a robust and flexible framework but also boasts modern features that enhance web development. One of the standout features of Statiq is its use of Razor pages for templating. This approach allows for dynamic content generation within static websites, providing a more interactive and customizable user experience.

## Learning Curve and Future Enhancements

Transitioning to a new system often comes with a learning curve, and Statiq is no exception. I am currently navigating through its extensive documentation and experimenting with its various functionalities. My goal is to harness Statiq's full potential to elevate the aesthetics and functionality of my blog.

## Looking Ahead

In the coming weeks, as I become more adept at using Statiq, you can expect to see noticeable improvements in the design and performance of my blog. The move to Statiq is not just about keeping up with technology trends; it's about providing a better, faster, and more engaging experience for you, the reader.

Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for joining me on this journey of continuous improvement and learning in the realm of digital content creation.
